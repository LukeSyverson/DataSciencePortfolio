# Childcare Affordability Project
The objective of this project was to provide a foundation to future analysis on the affordability topic by creating a data engineering script, modeling script, physical Power BI semantic model (with visualizations), and a predictive model.
Each model included services a different prospective audience in the interest of understanding contributing factors to childcare costs by region.

Opportunities to expand upon the analysis include futher filtering, interaction feature engineering, more optimal model choices, and more granular visualizations.
Please see the included white paper for more details.
